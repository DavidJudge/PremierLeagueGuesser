# PremierLeagueGuesser
A small game created by myself in Small Basic.


This program was created as an assignment for teaching use. 
The brief was to create a program that would allow a user to try and guess all teams in the current premier league. This was initially done with a manually entered array in Small Basic.

I then decided to rewrite the whole program using SubRoutines (more commonly known as Methods), which allowed for greater control of when events happened. I also added the file handling and congratulatory graphics window.
